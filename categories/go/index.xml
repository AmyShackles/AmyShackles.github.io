      <description>After hearing a lot about the Go programming language and its similarity to C, I decided to finally get around to trying to learn it (I&amp;rsquo;m currently watching Brenna Martenson&amp;rsquo;s course on Frontend Masters, &amp;ldquo;Go for JavaScript Developers&amp;rdquo;). And since the best way to ensure you&amp;rsquo;ve actually learned a thing is to teach a thing, I decided to start this blog. So join me as I muddle through the early stages of learning a language.</description>
